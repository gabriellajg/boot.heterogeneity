Title: A Monte Carlo Based Heterogeneity Test for Meta-Analysis
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Han Du <hdu@psych.ucla.edu>
Maintainer: Ge Jiang <gejiang2@illinois.edu>
Description: This package implements a Monte Carlo Based Heterogeneity Test for standardized mean differences (d), Fisher-transformed Pearson's correlations (r), and natural-logarithm-transformed odds ratio (OR) in Meta-Analysis Studies. Depending on the presence of moderators, this Monte Carlo Based Test can be implemented in the random or mixed-effects model. This package used rma() function from R package metafor to obtain effect size measures so installation of R package metafor is required.
